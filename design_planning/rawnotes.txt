billing systemupdate @/sample_billing requirements.md to build out requirments for this application I am trying to build using the context below and @/reqs-md.md 

We should also considering using appache kafka to send messages to a redis cache to then serve to the sqllite database so that way we can have more messges. 

I also want to display (using streamlit) another web application with a dashboard overview in near real time the cost metrics associated with chat threads and suers, as well as other metrics the SLA to displaying the data in streamlit should be 15 seconds. 

here is what I have so far:

The backend leverages SQLite (and Redis for caching) with robust data models to support dynamic token pricing and invoice generation. All components will be containerized using Docker for seamless local development and testing.

# LLM Chat Billing Proof of Concept Requirements

## 1. Project Overview

This project is a proof-of-concept (POC) web application that integrates a real-time chat interface with a dynamic billing system for LLM (Anthropic’s claude3.5-haiku) interactions. The application will provide real-time cost breakdowns for each chat thread and message while also displaying detailed token usage and pricing metrics. Additionally, a separate Streamlit-based dashboard will offer near real-time (15-second SLA) insights into cost metrics and overall system performance.

## 2. Technology Stack

- **Backend:**  
  - FastAPI with Pydantic for data validation and API endpoints  
  - Anthropic Python SDK (default model: claude3.5-haiku)
  - Apache Kafka for message queuing to handle high throughput

- **Database & Caching:**  
  - SQLite for primary data persistence  
  - Redis for caching and real-time data serving

- **Frontend:**  
  - React.js for a single-page application (SPA) that hosts the chat interface and data artifacts  
  - Streamlit for a separate dashboard displaying cost and usage metrics in near real time

- **Containerization & Orchestration:**  
  - Docker (with Docker Compose) to containerize the FastAPI, React, Redis, and Kafka components

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Message Flow:**
  - Users can create a new chat thread or rejoin an existing thread.
  - Users send messages in real time, with each message mapped to a specific chat thread.
  - Messages are routed through Apache Kafka to a Redis cache, which then stores them into SQLite, allowing scalability for higher message volumes.

- **Real-Time Cost & Billing Display:**
  - Next to the chat interface, display the cumulative cost for the entire thread.
  - Provide a detailed cost breakdown per message, including:
    - Total tokens used (input, output, etc.)
    - Cost invoiced per token type

- **User Identification:**
  - Implement a simple form to input a user ID (full authentication is not required for this POC).

### 3.2. Backend Services & LLM Integration

- **Chat Messaging Service:**
  - Develop FastAPI endpoints for chat creation, message sending, and message retrieval.
  - Integrate the Anthropic SDK to send and receive real messages using claude3.5-haiku.
  
- **Billing & Token Counting:**
  - For each message, count tokens (input, output, and others) and store details.
  - Calculate costs per message based on current token pricing.
  - Aggregate individual message costs into a cumulative thread total.
  - Generate detailed invoice line items and summary invoices.

- **Asynchronous Processing:**
  - Use Apache Kafka to queue incoming messages, decoupling message receipt from processing.
  - Process messages from Kafka to update Redis and eventually write to SQLite.

### 3.3. Billing Dashboard (Streamlit)

- **Dashboard Features:**
  - Display a real-time overview of cost metrics for chat threads and users.
  - Provide visualizations for:
    - Total cost per thread
    - Message-level cost breakdown

  - Use of Kafka and Redis to support high message volumes and real-time processing.

- **Performance:**
  - Ensure real-time responsiveness for chat and billing updates.
  - Optimize data queries from SQLite and use Redis caching where necessary.
  - Streamlit dashboard data updates should not exceed a 15-second latency.

- **Extensibility:**
