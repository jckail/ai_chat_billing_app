## 🎯 Purpose

This application is designed to solve the challenge of monitoring and billing for AI model usage in chat-based applications. As organizations increasingly deploy AI assistants, understanding the costs associated with these interactions becomes critical for business planning and cost management.

**Key problems addressed:**
- Real-time tracking of token usage and associated costs
- Detailed breakdown of costs at the message and thread level
- Historical analytics for budget forecasting and usage patterns
- Near real-time metrics with minimal latency (15-second SLA)

The system provides a complete billing pipeline for AI chat applications, making it suitable for both internal cost tracking and customer-facing billing scenarios.

## 🔍 Overview

This project implements a comprehensive system to track chat interactions with AI models (primarily Anthropic's Claude), calculate real-time costs based on token usage, and provide analytics through a dedicated dashboard. The application consists of several components:

- **Backend API**: FastAPI application that handles chat interactions and billing
- **Event Collector**: Service that captures API events for billing purposes
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Streamlit application providing real-time cost metrics
- **Frontend**: React single-page application for the chat interface (not yet implemented)
- **Message Queue**: Apache Kafka for handling high message volumes
- **Cache**: Redis for fast access to message history and metrics

## 🏗️ Architecture

The application follows a microservices architecture with the following components:

1. **User Interface**: React SPA communicates with the FastAPI backend
2. **Backend API**: Processes user messages, interacts with the Anthropic API, and tracks token usage
3. **Kafka Message Queue**: Handles various event types (raw messages, LLM responses, token metrics)
4. **Event Collector**: Captures events from API interactions for billing
5. **Redis Cache**: Stores message history and metrics for fast access
6. **SQLite Database**: Persists all data including user information, threads, messages, and billing
7. **Streamlit Dashboard**: Displays real-time analytics with a 15-second refresh SLA

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Anthropic API key
- Git

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai_thread_billing.git
cd ai_thread_billing
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

cp .env.sample .env
```

Edit the `.env` file and add your Anthropic API key.

### 3. Build and Start Docker Containers

```bash
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

### 4. Access the Applications

- Backend API: http://localhost:8000
